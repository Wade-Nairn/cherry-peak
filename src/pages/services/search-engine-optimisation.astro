        An SEO campaign aims to demonstrate to search engines that your website is the
        most relevant for specific phrases or keywords your target audience is searching for.
        The better your website, the higher it will rank in search results. Securing a place on
        Google's first page gives you a competitive advantage and ensures your business
        reaches the right audience.

        The SEO process begins by identifying the most suitable keywords for your business
        and then optimising your website's content accordingly. However, SEO goes beyond
        simply using keywords repeatedly. Effective strategies consider various SEO ranking
        factors, including off-page signals like backlinks, local SEO, and your website's
        technical performance.
